Based in the "ratpack project template" included in link:https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones[lazybones]

For demo purposes, just the link:https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt[Java JWT] library has been used, in a realworld application
based on ratpack, you probably want to rely on link:http://ratpack.io/manual/current/pac4j.html#pac4j[PAC4J] to handle authentication (including JWT).

You can start the demo server app with

[source]
----
./gradlew run
----

The server is then available via http://localhost:5050`
